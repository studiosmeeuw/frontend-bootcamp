# Variables

Variables are, like any other program language, placeholders for all kinds of data. It is possible to define a variable, adjust its value or even clear it.

## Types

### String

A text value (repesented between two single- or double quotes).

```javascript
// the following variable stores the name of the current POTUS (President of the United States of America)
var nameOfPotus = 'Barack Obama';
```

### Integer

A numeric value.

```javascript
// the following variable stores the age of the current POTUS
var ageOfPotus = 52;
```

### Boolean

A true/false value.

```javascript
// the following variable stores the marital status of the current POTUS
var isPotusMarried = true;
```
### Object

A collection value that can store multiple values through a object literal syntax, which is a notation where key and value are divided by a colon, pairs by a comma and the collection is wrapped by curly brackets.

```javascript
// the following variable stores all data regarding the current POTUS
var currentPotus = {
	firstName: 'Barack',
	lastName: 'Obama',
	age: 52,
	isMarried: true
};
```
